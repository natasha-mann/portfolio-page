## About the Project

This project is my personal portfolio and features examples of my GitHub projects. The project was completed during week 2 of my Coding Bootcamp and the brief was to create a working portfolio which was fully responsive, used flex containers, media queries and CSS variables.

The portfolio includes the following sections:

- About Me
- Projects
- Contact

### Features

- The page is fully responsive for all screen sizes
- It includes some accessibility features (eg. alt attributes).
- Animations on image and text on title page
- Nav links change colour and size when hovered over.
- Project images change size when hovered over.
- Project images are linked to deployed project pages.
- Hidden navbar element for mobile users, utilizing the animations in CSS along with pseudo-classes to apply certain CSS properties when a box is selected. This could be further improved in the future with Javascript, as noted below.

## Plans for Improvement

In the future I would like to develop the page further, to include some Javascript and other advanced CSS features. Primarily, I would aim to implement the following features:

- A "scroll-snap" feature on desktop to lock the viewport to each new section once the user has finished scrolling.
- An "internationalization" feature to allow the user to switch the site to their preferred language.
- A "dark-mode" element
- An improved hidden navbar for mobile users which drops down from the top when a button is clicked, and retracts when the user selects a menu item.
